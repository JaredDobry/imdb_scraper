# Features of Interest:
# Popularity is definitely important, seems to be an aggregate of vote count, # of favorited
# and # of times added to watchlist
# Revenue to me is more telling than budget, while there are some terrible movies that
# rake in money, usually the well-watched ones have grossed a lot of revenue.
# Vote Count is pretty important, because regardless of good or bad votes, a high vote count
# suggests a lot of views.
# Production Companies I think is a lowkey important feature, maybe from country to country
# it varies, but the well-watched movies are made by the same big name production companies.
